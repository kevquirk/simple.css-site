Well here we are, a new blog on the Simple.css site, check us out!

> But Kev, why have you added a blog to this site?

That's a great question, dear reader. I thought I'd write this quick post to firstly add some content so the [news page](/news) doesn't look quite so barren.

Secondly, the Simple.css project is getting more popular, so I wanted a way to share news about updates to the project and the various things I'm doing with it. This way, you know what I'm doing and where the project is headed.

Finally, there is an RSS feed too. So if you're that way inclined you can [subscribe](/feed.xml).
